This directory contains the modular source code for the game, organized by language and purpose.

## Directory Structure

### `/modules/src` - Frontend Source Files

Contains TypeScript and SCSS source files that are compiled into the final game interface:

- **`dondelaspapasqueman.ts`** - TypeScript source for the game UI (edit this file)
- **`dondelaspapasqueman.scss`** - SCSS stylesheet source
- **`dondelaspapasqueman.d.ts`** - TypeScript type definitions

**Important:** These source files are compiled using Rollup and Sass. The compiled output goes to:

- `modules/js/Game.js` (from TypeScript)
- `dondelaspapasqueman.css` (from SCSS, in project root)

Do NOT edit the compiled files directly - always edit the source files in `/modules/src`.

### `/modules/js` - Compiled JavaScript Output

Contains the compiled JavaScript output:

- **`Game.js`** - Auto-generated from `modules/src/dondelaspapasqueman.ts`
  - This file is automatically created by the build process
  - Do not edit manually - changes will be overwritten

### `/modules/php` - Backend PHP Files

Contains PHP classes and modules for server-side game logic:

- **`Game.php`** - Main game logic class
- **`States/`** - Game state machine classes
- Additional PHP utility classes as needed

## Naming Conventions

When adding new PHP or JavaScript utility files, it is recommended to name them starting with a trigram of your game name to avoid namespace collisions.

For example, if you have a class to manage pathfinding in the game Tobago, it would be called:

- `TBGPathFinding.php` (PHP file)
- The class inside would be called `TBGPathFinding`

For this game (DondeLasPapasQueman), you could use the trigram `DLP` or `DPQ`.

## Build Process

The frontend source files are compiled using:

- **Rollup** - Bundles TypeScript to JavaScript (`modules/js/Game.js`)
- **Sass** - Compiles SCSS to CSS (`dondelaspapasqueman.css`)

Run `npm run build` to compile once, or `npm run watch` for automatic recompilation during development.
